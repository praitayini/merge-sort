# Implementing merge sort for patient information

Starting to build towards a pathology report analysis system in python. The first step in this system is build components that help can read in the unstructured file and organize the information into some structure and save it back in some sorted order for later use.

The pathology reports used are not in the repo due to confidential issues.
