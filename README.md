# Implementing merge sort for patient information

Starting to build towards a pathology report analysis system in python. The first step in this system is build components that help can read in the unstructured file and organize the information into some structure and save it back in some sorted order for later use.

The pathology reports used are not in the repo due to confidential issues.

The mysort1.py is the merge sort algorithm. The extract.py is used to extract patient information from the pathological report and create a list. Then, the merge sort algorithm from mysort1 is used to sort the patient list. The testMergesort.py has three cases to test the merge sort in mysort1.py
